JTrivia
==============

General knowledge trivia game. Each game is randomly constructed from a
pool of over 320,000 clues from the **Jeopardy!** television show. 

Clues were collected from [J!Archive](http://j-archive.com), a fan-maintained repository of 
**Jeopardy!** clues and episode data, using the web scraper I developed [here](https://github.com/anderMatt/jarchive-scraper).
